MANASIG: Python Package to MAnipulate NAnopore SIGnals from sequencing files

Thus we present a Python package designed to manipulate, extract and process nanopore sequencing files and provide a helpful tool to analyze squiggles. It provides a single API to access the reads attributes allowing extraction and signal visualization. The package can work with base-called data and provide a known BLAST search process to select specific regions of interest.
